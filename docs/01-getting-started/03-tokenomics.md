Tokenomics refers to the economic structure and incentive mechanisms that govern token creation, distribution, and management within a blockchain ecosystem. It encompasses the token supply, allocation, and usage design to ensure the network's sustainability and growth. Effective tokenomics align stakeholders' interests, encourage participation, and support the overall functionality and security of the blockchain platform.
