Jumbo Blockchain introduces a groundbreaking incentive model that rewards users, nodes, and validators for their engagement, commitment, and sustainable practices within the ecosystem.

**Initial Airdrops and Joining Incentives** : Jumbo Blockchain is pioneering a novel initiative to welcome new users by offering airdrops of its native coin to holders of tokens on other blockchains (such as Ethereum, BSC, and Bitcoin). This initial fund aims to encourage active participation within the Jumbo ecosystem, allowing for seamless transactions, trading, NFT interactions, and more.

**Staking Rewards** : Users staking their native Jumbo tokens will receive attractive returns at the end of the staking period, enhancing validator involvement and fostering investment in the network's expansion. This mechanism guarantees rewards for dedicated participants, offering the option to unstake after the lock-in period through the convenience of smart contracts.

**Sustainability Score Bonuses** : Focusing on environmental stewardship, Jumbo Blockchain introduces a reward system tied to a sustainability score, motivating validators to align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). This approach not only champions eco-friendly practices but also embeds them into the fundamental operational principles of the blockchain.

**Validator Participation Rewards** : Validators actively participating in the consensus mechanism will receive a portion of the transaction gas fees as a reward. This incentivizes consistent and fair participation in network validation, ensuring the blockchain's integrity and efficiency.

**Penalties for Malicious Activities** : To maintain network integrity, Jumbo Blockchain implements a penalty system for malicious or non-compliant behaviour. Validators face potential penalties for extended downtime, failure to meet sustainability commitments, or engaging in dishonest actions like multiple signings. These measures are designed to uphold the blockchain's security and trustworthiness, ensuring a fair and sustainable ecosystem for all participants.

Jumbo Blockchain's incentive and penalty frameworks are crafted to foster a robust, sustainable, and participatory blockchain environment, rewarding positive contributions while discouraging and penalising harmful actions.
