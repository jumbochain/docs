Staking refers to the process of actively participating in a blockchain network by locking up a certain amount of native currency as collateral to support the network's operations. In return for staking their coins, participants often receive rewards, such as additional tokens, for helping to validate transactions and maintain the security and integrity of the network. Staking plays a crucial role in decentralizing and securing blockchain networks, as it incentivizes users to actively contribute to the network's functionality while earning rewards for their efforts.
