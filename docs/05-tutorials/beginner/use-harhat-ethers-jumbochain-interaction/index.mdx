title: Interacting with Smart Contracts on Jumbochain (hardhat & ethers)
---

This tutorial will guide you through the process of interacting with a
smart contract on Jumbochain. We'll cover these steps:

1. Setting up your development environment with Hardhat.

2. Creating a simple smart contract.

3. Obtaining testnet tokens from the ProtoJumbo faucet.

4. Deploying the smart contract to the JumboChain testnet.

5. Writing a Node.js script using Ethers.js to interact with the deployed
contract.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm: Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.
You can download them from nodejs.org.

- Basic understanding of Solidity: Familiarity with Solidity, the smart
contract programming language, is helpful but not required.

## Step 1: Setting up the Development Environment

We'll use Hardhat, a development environment for compiling, deploying, testing,
and debugging.
Since JumboChain is EVM-compatible, Hardhat works well.

Create a project directory:

```bash
mkdir jumbochain-tutorial
cd jumbochain-tutorial
```

Initialize a new Node.js project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Install Hardhat:

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

Install Ethers.js:

```bash
npm install --save-dev ethers
```

Install dotenv (for managing environment variables):

```bash
npm install --save-dev dotenv
```

Set up Hardhat:

```bash
npx hardhat
```

When prompted, select "Create a sample project".
This will set up a basic Hardhat project structure.

## Step 2: Create a Simple Smart Contract

Let's create a very basic smart contract.

Create a new Solidity file: Inside the contracts directory, create a file named SimpleStorage.sol:

```bash
touch contracts/SimpleStorage.sol
```

Add the following code to contracts/SimpleStorage.sol:

```solidity title="contracts/SimpleStorage.sol
contract SimpleStorage {
  uint256 storedData;
  
  constructor(uint256 initVal) {
  storedData = initVal;
  }
  
  function set(uint256 x) public {
  storedData = x;
  }
  
  function get() public view returns (uint256) {
  return storedData;
  }
}
```

This contract has a constructor that takes an initial value, a `set` function
to modify the stored data, and a `get` function to retrieve it.

## Step 3: Obtain Testnet Tokens

To deploy and interact with smart contracts on JumboChain, you'll need testnet
tokens. If you are using protojumbo testnet, request tokens [here](https://protojumbo.jumbochain.org/faucet-smart).

Generally, faucets provide tokens to your wallet address on testnet.

:::warning
Handle your private keys with extreme care. Never share them publicly.
:::

:::tip
Search for "ProtoJumbo faucet" to find the official website or use chainlink.

Follow the instructions on the faucet website to obtain testnet tokens.

This usually involves providing your wallet address.
:::

## Step 4: Deploy the Smart Contract

Now, let's deploy the SimpleStorage contract to the JumboChain testnet.

1. Configure Hardhat: You need to configure Hardhat to connect to the JumboChain network.  Open hardhat.config.js and modify it as follows:

  ```javascript title="hardhat.config.js
  const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;
  const JUMBOCHAIN_RPC_URL = process.env.JUMBOCHAIN_RPC_URL || "http://your-jumbochain-rpc-url:8545";  // Replace with the actual RPC URL
  
  module.exports = {
    solidity: "0.8.17", // Or the version you are using
    networks: {
      jumbochain: {
        url: JUMBOCHAIN_RPC_URL,
        accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY],
        chainId: 1992, // Or the Chain ID of JumboChain
      },
    },
  };
  ```

    - Replace `http://your-jumbochain-rpc-url:8545` with the actual RPC URL for the
      JumboChain testnet.
      This is crucial for Hardhat to communicate with the blockchain.
    
    - Replace 1992 with the correct Chain ID for JumboChain.
    
    - You'll need to set the `PRIVATE_KEY` and `JUMBOCHAIN_RPC_URL` environment variables.

2. Create a .env file

  In your project root directory, create a .env file to store your private key and RPC URL:

  ```bash
  touch .env
  ```

3. Add your private key and RPC URL to .env

  ```bash
  PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"  # Replace with your actual private key
  JUMBOCHAIN_RPC_URL="http://your-jumbochain-rpc-url:8545"  # Replace with the JumboChain RPC URL
  ```

  :::warning
  Never commit your .env file to a public repository, as it contains
  your private key!  
  Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.
  :::

4. Create a deployment script: In the scripts directory, create a file named deploy.js:

  ```bash
  touch scripts/deploy.js
  ```
  
5. Add the following code to scripts/deploy.js:

  ```javascript
  async function main() {
    const SimpleStorage = await ethers.getContractFactory("SimpleStorage");
    const initialValue = 42;  // You can change the initial value here
    const simpleStorage = await SimpleStorage.deploy(initialValue);
  
    await simpleStorage.deployed();
  
    console.log("Deployed SimpleStorage to:", simpleStorage.address);
  
  }
  
  main()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
      process.exit(1);
    });
  ```
  
  This script uses `ethers.getContractFactory` to get the contract object,
  deploys it with an initial value, and then logs the deployed contract's address.

6. Compile the contract:

  ```bash
  npx hardhat compile
  ```

7. the contract:
  
  ```bash
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network jumbochain
  ```

This command runs the deploy.js script on the jumbochain network (which we configured in hardhat.config.js).

You should see the deployed contract address in the console output.

Record this address; We will need it in the next step.

## Step 5: Interact with the Smart Contract using Ethers.js

Now, let's write a Node.js script to interact with the deployed contract using Ethers.js.

Create a new JavaScript file: Create a file named interact.js in your project root directory:

```bash
touch interact.js
```

Add the following code to interact.js:

```javascript titile="interact.js"
// Contract ABI (Application Binary Interface) - from SimpleStorage.json
const contractABI = [
  "constructor(uint256)",
  "function get() public view returns (uint256)",
  "function set(uint256 x) public",
];

// Replace with your contract address and RPC URL
const contractAddress = "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"; // Replace with the deployed contract address
const rpcUrl = process.env.JUMBOCHAIN_RPC_URL || "http://your-jumbochain-rpc-url:8545";

// Private key of the account that will send transactions
const privateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;

async function main() {
  // 1. Connect to the JumboChain network using the RPC URL
  const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl);

  // 2. Create a wallet instance using your private key
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

  // 3. Create a contract instance
  const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, wallet);

  console.log("Connected to contract:", contract.address);

  // 4. Call the 'get' function to retrieve the current value
  console.log("Calling get()...");
  const currentValue = await contract.get();
  console.log("Current value:", currentValue.toString());

  // 5. Call the 'set' function to update the value
  const newValue = 123;
  console.log("Calling set() with value:", newValue);
  const tx = await contract.set(newValue);
  console.log("Transaction hash:", tx.hash);

  // Wait for the transaction to be mined (optional, but recommended)
  console.log("Waiting for transaction to be mined...");
  await tx.wait();
  console.log("Transaction mined!");

  // 6. Call 'get' again to verify the updated value
  console.log("Calling get() again to verify...");
  const updatedValue = await contract.get();
  console.log("Updated value:", updatedValue.toString());
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error:", error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

Replace `YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with the address of your deployed contract.

Ensure that the rpcUrl matches the JumboChain RPC URL.

The contractABI array defines the functions in your smart contract,
allowing Ethers.js to interact with it.  

:::tip
For real-world applications, it's best to import the ABI from a
JSON file generated by Hardhat (e.g., SimpleStorage.json).
For this simple example, we've included it directly in the code for clarity.

You can get the ABI from the `artifacts/contracts/SimpleStorage.sol/SimpleStorage.json`
file after compiling.
:::

Run the interact.js script:

```bash
node interact.js
```

This script will:

- Connect to the JumboChain network.

- Create a wallet using your private key.

- Create a contract instance using the address and ABI.

- Call the `get()` function to get the initial value.

- Call the `set()` function to change the value.

- Call `get()` again to confirm the change.

## Conclusion

You have successfully deployed a smart contract to the Jumbochain testnet and
interacted with it using Ethers.js!

This tutorial provides a basic framework for building more complex
decentralized applications on JumboChain.
