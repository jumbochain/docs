PoN has been meticulously designed, incorporating a comprehensive analysis of potential security threats to fortify its security architecture. The protocol dynamically addresses risks such as Sybil attacks, majority attacks, eclipse attack , among others.

## Sybil attacks

A Sybil attack is a type of attack in which a malicious actor creates multiple fake identities, known as Sybil nodes, to gain control or disrupt a decentralized network. This attack is particularly problematic in peer-to-peer networks, including blockchain networks, where nodes interact based on the assumption that each node represents a unique entity.

Jumbo blockchain with its unique consensus mechanism will ensure the **random selection** of validator nodes specifically based on uptime and node utilization apart from stakes, sustainability score and capacity.

Jumbochain, rotates the verifier nodes, from a pool of nodes. Thereby largely reducing the chance of hackers to take control of the fifty/major percent verifier nodes of the chain which are picked for a transaction approval.

## Majority attack

A majority attack, also known as a **51% attack**, is a security threat in blockchain networks where a single entity or a colluding group of entities controls more than 50% of the total computational power (hash rate) of the network. This attack allows the controlling entity to manipulate the blockchain's decentralized consensus mechanism and potentially disrupt its operation.

Jumbo Blockchain, in its consensus mechanism, rotates the validator nodes after a predefined time. This reduces the chances for cartelization.

Here, After every short interval the participating nodes will automatically be rotated out of the pool and new nodes will be selected. This will rule out the possibility of cartelization as the participating nodes will not be able to identify which validator node will be selected as the randomization will happen automatically.

## Eclipse attack

This attack tries to isolate the victim from the valid data flow of the network. This type of attack is usually due to the limitation in number of connections and safe selection of nodes.

Jumbo blockchain utilizes the verification process at the time of selecting a validator node. A form is issued to the node which wants to be part of the validator pool. Even the nodes, which will be responsible for validating a transaction, are selected based on parameters. Also the node, after some time will be made to sleep. This will considerably reduce the chances of compromising the node on the network.

## Cryptographic Foundations

Central to PoN is a solid cryptographic foundation, utilizing sophisticated algorithms to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of transactions. Essential components of this cryptographic framework include:

- **Secure Hash Functions (SHF)**: These functions generate a unique hash for every input, ensuring data integrity.

- **Digital Signatures (DS)**: Utilizing public and private keys, digital signatures confirm the authenticity and integrity of messages.

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**: ZKP enables the verification of information without disclosing the information itself.

Integrating these cryptographic technologies into the PoN protocol guarantees high-level security and privacy for all participants in the blockchain network. With ongoing evaluation, analysis, and enhancements, PoN continuously leads in blockchain security, protecting user interests and sustaining community trust.
